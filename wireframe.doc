About Me
Growing up under the endless skies of Quilpie, a small town in the heart of Queensland's outback, I learnt from an early age the value of hard work, resilience, and resourcefulness. My childhood was filled with the raw beauty of the bush — mustering cattle across the central desert, riding horses beneath helicopters, and sleeping under the brilliant canopy of stars. These experiences shaped not just my character but my approach to life: hands-on, hardworking, and determined to succeed, no matter the terrain.
As I grew, my journey led me from chasing bulls in the desert to drilling for precious water across the McDonald Ranges and the Great Sandy Desert. There, I played a role in supporting remote farms and safeguarding wildlife, understanding the deep connection between people, land, and resourcefulness. Later, I transitioned into the LNG gas fields, working for industry giants like Shell, Origin Energy, and Nitschke Service Rigs. Working shifts in harsh environments, operating heavy machinery, and maintaining critical drilling infrastructure developed my technical skills, precision, and a strong focus on safety and teamwork.
Every step of the way, from cattle stations to drilling rigs, my passion for problem-solving and my love for the technical side of operations continued to grow. Over time, it became clear that my future would lead into the world of technology — where logic, creativity, and technical expertise meet.
Now, armed with a Diploma of Web Development through Coder Academy and AIT, I’m ready to carve a new path in the tech industry. My journey from the dust of the outback to the digital frontier brings a unique perspective to the world of coding: a fusion of practical, real-world problem-solving, discipline, and the ability to adapt quickly and perform under pressure.
The skills I offer the tech world — and future clients — are founded on real-world grit and dedication. With hands-on experience in teamwork, technical operations, and independent problem-solving, I am passionate about building websites and applications that not only work flawlessly but also improve people's lives. Whether coding a clean, responsive design or building solutions that help businesses run smoother, I bring the same energy, focus, and drive that once helped me muster cattle across vast deserts.
On my website, you will find more details about my technical skills — from programming languages to project experience — alongside my contact information for opportunities to connect and collaborate. I believe technology should be a tool to simplify the complex and bring people closer together. Through my unique journey, I’m excited to be part of building a better, easier future for businesses and communities everywhere.

Skills Summary
My skills are built from a lifetime of hands-on experience and technical evolution.
In the field, I mastered mechanical operations, problem-solving under pressure, and technical maintenance — skills that now translate into my web development abilities.
I am proficient in web design, responsive layouts, and coding languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
I approach every project with a keen focus on user experience (UX), accessibility, and mobile optimisation, bringing practical solutions to real-world needs.
Work and Project History
From riding under helicopters mustering cattle across the deserts of Western Queensland to drilling water wells for farms and working on Origin’s gas fields, I developed grit, resilience, and technical precision.
Now, I combine that real-world experience with technical knowledge to deliver websites and solutions that make people’s lives easier.
Each project I take on reflects my journey — hardworking, grounded, and built to last.
